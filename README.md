A Java library for rendering 3D spatial data

Hello World

A first attempt to render the Utah Teapot.

<img alt="A yellow rendering of the Utah Teapot" src="data/HelloWorldUtahTeapot1.png" />

There are some black pixels which is probably to do with intersection issues rather than rendering issues.

Running [src/main/java/uk/ac/leeds/ccg/r3d/RenderImage.java] should produce this image in a few minutes.

There are about 9000 triangles considered in the [data/](input data).
